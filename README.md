# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am a junior at NJIT for Business & Information Systems major. 
I love playing sports such as Tennis, Golf, and I recently started practicing Karate.
My interests are Merchandising Planning and Buying. I would also love to so something related with project management for a retail brand.
